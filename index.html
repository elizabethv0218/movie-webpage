    <h1>Mueller's Comedic Fails</h1>
    <h2>Here He Goes Again!</h2>

    <h3>STORY</h3>
    <p>SCHOOL used to be a lifeless system meant to stress students beyond belief. Not anymore!
      <br><br>WELCOME to Mr. Mueller’s Software class! Being the wacky adult that he is, Mr. Mueller tries his best to get a laugh out of his students every now and then only to fail miserably.
      <br><br>STUDENTS walk in peachy, but leave s-peach-less. Bad huh? That’s how Mr. Mueller runs his class; attempting to be punny with dad jokes! Ranging from puns about pirates, that may have been pirated, to names, like the ONE about JUAN, he will make you react like a cricket.
      <br><br>PREPARE yourselves for the the movie of the century! The holidays are coming near! We guarantee that Mueller’s Comedic Fails will have you awkwardly saying HA. HA. HA. instead of HO! HO! HO! or your money back.</p>
      <h6>COME to the LIVE SHOW in Broadway and we’ll offer free steak. We promise this isn’t a mi-steak.</h6>
      <h3>UTTER PUN-ISHMENT!</h3>
      <p>This is the perfect PUNishment for anyone when they fail, but not as badly as Mueller...</p>
      <h2>WARNING!!!!</h2>
      <h3>THIS MOVIE CONTAINS SCENES OF A TEACHER IRONICALLY FAILING TO TEACH GOOD HUMOR. Mr. Mueller approves of this message.</h3>

    <p><strong>@mimi-yahia</strong> Oh ya-ya he was my teacher! He taught me how to be peppermint and he gives great encourage-mint! This movie is an easy 5 out of 5!</p>
    <p><strong>@idk</strong> I was grateful for the theatre chairs. I thought I was going to faint! I’m going to give this movie a-</p>
    <p><strong>@mueller-productions</strong> Thank you <strong>@idk</strong>! Don’t worry, we will provide aspirin in theatres so that you won't collapse from the comedy acts! When you wake up from unconsciousness, please give us a good rating!</p>
    <p><strong>@peppermint2.0</strong> He’s from Colorado, but he didn’t have to leave us in a STATE of shock. I didn't expect those puns to take the COLOR-ADO my face. Being an old math teacher, he should subtract those puns because I can’t EVEN anymore. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11… I’ll wait until I can use an even number to give a rating.</p>
